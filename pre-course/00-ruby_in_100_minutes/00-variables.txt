#  *time_machine            ==> good
#  *student_count_integer   ==> bad style, contains data type
#  *homeworkAssignment      ==> bad style, camel- instead of snake-cased
#  *3_sections              ==> invalid, doesn't start with lower case letter
#  *top_ppl                 ==> bad style, abbreviated.
